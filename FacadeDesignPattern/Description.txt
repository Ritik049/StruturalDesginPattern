Facade Design Pattern: Provide a simplified, interface, library, or framework or any other complex set of classes.
It is actually a tradeoff between functionality and simplicity.

Problem: When we need to work with many classes  together, suppose we make them separate and in Client.java we are giving them instructions,
but using these classes and their code make our client.java clumsy and writing that code every time may lead to forget user something usage.

//SO FACADE provides a interface/library/framework so user just need to use that framework and put arguments accordingly and we just need to use facade and just put arguments as per our need.

//"FACADE pattern provides a simplified interface which hides the complexities of interacting multiple subsystems, making it easier to understand."
