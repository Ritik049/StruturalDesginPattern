Adapter Design Pattern: It allows objects incompatible to each other to collaborate, 

//Problem:
//Client needs JSON object but we have XML object providing the same functionality which client wants in JSON.


Solution: 
As both XML object and JSON object are incompatible to each other we need to convert them into compatible  using adapter for client.
//XML goes into adapter and this adapter return JSON object.

//Structure
1) Client ->This provide client to  use adpater with given XML object, pass as argument.
2) Interface->Adapter ->This provide the base method which different adapter uses.
3)Adapter -> It is a concrete implementation of Interface Adapter which takes XML object as argument.
It returns the object which client wants, suppose client want .xlx so we can make accordingly.
